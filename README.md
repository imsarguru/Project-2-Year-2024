 The project aims to create a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing, simulating, and 
solving the Rubik's Cube using Python, OpenCV, Kociemba, VPython, and NumPy. Key 
goals include developing robust algorithms for color recognition, creating a dynamic 
and interactive three-dimensional simulation, integrating the Kociemba algorithm for 
automatic solving of scrambled configurations, designing an intuitive user interface for 
inputting scrambled cube configurations, and providing clear feedback throughout the 
solving process, and developing an educational resource for learning about the Rubik's 
Cube, its mechanics, and solving techniques.
